# Commitment to SIF in Australia

There is explicit support in the Australian education sector for both the use of SIF, and the emergence of the 'Information Hub' pattern of 
market engagement.

Extract taken from: **Statement of Status and Intent for SIF adoption in Australia**

    SIF has been used in the USA for more than a decade to enable interoperability between software 
    products within schools districts and to facilitate data exchange between schools, school 
    systems and education authorities. SIF is also in the early stages of adoption in the UK and 
    under investigation in several other countries. Currently more than 15 million students benefit 
    every day from interoperability delivered via SIF.

    In Australia currently there are over 40 member organisations including education authorities and 
    software vendors. SIF has been used in projects involving government and non-government schools 
    in all States and Territories. These include local, national and cross-jurisdictional initiatives 
    spanning access to online learning resources, online assessment, enterprise wide data synchronisation, 
    student data transfer and national reporting.

    In Australia, the SIF Association recognised the benefit in creating a targeted subset or profile of 
    the full Australian Data Model to assist in more speedy and lightweight adoption of the interoperability 
    standard.

    The Student Information System Baseline Profile (SBP) is a set of core data and business rules defining 
    the relationship between students, parents, teachers, schools and classes. It has reduced the complexity 
    and cost for schools and increased the ease for vendors in creating interoperability between applications 
    and student (or school) information systems.

    The SBP is now used across Tasmania, ACT, South Australia, and the Northern Territory with Student 
    Information System (SIS) vendors providing core identity data to external applications and services.

    The level of SIS vendor engagement with SIF is evidence of the degree of general market adoption of SIF. 
    Ten out of thirteen leading SIS vendors have an active interest in working with SIF and five have operating 
    agents developed as a result of participation in NSIP supported pilot projects.

    SIF enjoys wide support across the Australian education software community.

     

The following quotes are from a strategic direction statement issued by NSW Department of Education and Communities (DEC) March 2014

    The Learning Management Business Reform Program (LMBR) is delivering a common and standardised Student 
    Administration and Learning Management (SALM) solution to all NSW public schools. This solution has 
    recently been implemented in 229 schools. It is recognised that some schools have access to functionality 
    beyond that currently available through the SALM solution through various external third party systems...

    In response to feedback from principals that many schools wish to continue to use external third party 
    systems for specific student and learning management functions, an announcement was made on Thursday 13th March 2014 
    to the 229 schools that the Department will implement a framework to enable third party systems to integrate 
    with the Department’s SALM solution where they provide additional functionality. The framework is to be 
    delivered by the NSW DEC Information Technology Directorate (ITD) sponsored by Stephen Loquet. 
    The framework will leverage the investment made from the pilot phase of the Integration Competency Centre (ICC) 
    that NSIP has supported over the last 12-24 months...

    Technically, the framework will utilise the SIF Infrastructure (version 3.0.1 or above) and the Australian specific 
    SIF Data Model (version 1.4 or above). The data exchanged will flow in two directions:

    In the outbound SIF flow, the framework publishes and makes available DEC’s core information - school records, 
    courses and subjects, student records, school staff records - to authenticated, authorised and targeted external 
    third party systems. This information is necessary for external third party timetabling and attendance management 
    systems to return their data to DEC.

    In the inbound SIF flow, the framework provides a gateway for the SALM solution to receive two types of data from 
    external third party systems. The timetabling data type consists of timetables, daily variations and roll classes 
    generated and administered by external third party systems. The attendance data type represents student and 
    teacher’s class attendance (period- or day-based) information recorded against school timetables.
