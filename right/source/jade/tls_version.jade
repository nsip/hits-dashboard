                                        p The following information applies mainly to developers using the Java version of the SIF Common Framework:
                                        p It is important to note that TLSv1.0 will deprecate in 2017. It is no longer considered a secure version of TLS. However, by default Java 7 uses TLSv1.0. 
                                        p This may cause issues in some integrations where that TLS version is no longer enabled. 
                                        p To ensure that the adapters written with the SIF Java framework support a given TLS version, you can set this version in the environment.properties file. Simply set the property called env.tls.version in that file to a value of TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2. Your adapter will now use the appropriate TLS version to connect to the endpoint.
